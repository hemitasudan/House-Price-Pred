House Price Prediction using Machine Learning
This project presents a machine learning-based solution to predict house prices based on key property features such as area, number of rooms, and location. The notebook includes steps for data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to accurately estimate house prices using supervised machine learning algorithms. The entire pipeline—from data cleaning and visualization to model selection and evaluation—was implemented in a Jupyter Notebook using Python libraries.

Results

1. Introduction
This notebook-based project focuses on predicting house prices by applying machine learning techniques to a structured dataset. The features include variables such as area, location, number of bedrooms, and more.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis
A thorough EDA was conducted to understand data distribution, correlations, and outliers. Key steps include:

Visualizing feature relationships using heatmaps, scatter plots, and histograms

Identifying and handling missing values

Detecting outliers and skewed distributions

3. Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into models, the following preprocessing steps were applied:

Handling missing data

Encoding categorical features like location

Feature scaling and normalization for numerical consistency

4. Model Building
Multiple regression models were implemented and compared:

Linear Regression: As a baseline model

Decision Tree Regressor: To capture non-linear patterns

Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble approach for better accuracy

XGBoost Regressor: To leverage gradient boosting performance

5. Evaluation Metrics
Each model's performance was assessed using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

These metrics help compare how well each model generalizes on unseen data.

6. Results
After training and tuning, the models were evaluated and compared. The best-performing model (Random Forest or XGBoost, based on your results) demonstrated high accuracy and consistency across the test set.
