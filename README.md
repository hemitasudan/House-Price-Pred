# House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to build a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features like area, number of rooms, location, etc. The notebook includes data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using a machine learning model trained on relevant features. By leveraging different algorithms and methodologies, we seek to understand how well we can predict the value of properties.

## 1. Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict the prices of houses based on several features using machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains multiple features that influence the price, such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, location, etc.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Before building any models, a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the structure of the data. EDA includes:

- Visualizing relationships between different features and the target variable (house prices).
- Identifying missing values, outliers, and feature distributions.

## 3. Data Processing

This step involves preparing the data for model training. Data preprocessing steps include:

- Handling missing data.
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., locations).
- Normalizing or scaling numerical features to ensure that all variables contribute equally to the model.
  
## 4. Model Building

Several machine learning models are trained to predict house prices. The following algorithms are explored:

- **Linear Regression**: A baseline model to predict prices based on a linear relationship between features.
- **Decision Trees**: A tree-based model that captures non-linear interactions between features.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines the predictions of multiple decision trees.
- **XGBoost**: A powerful gradient boosting algorithm that often achieves state-of-the-art performance on structured datasets.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics, such as:

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- **RÂ² Score**: A measure of how well the predicted values match the actual values.

## 6. Results & Best Model

The results from each model are compared, and the model with the best performance is highlighted. The project concludes by discussing the best model and its ability to generalize to unseen data.

## Installation
